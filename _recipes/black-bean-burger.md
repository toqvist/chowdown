ingredients:
- 4dl cooked quinoa
- 4dl cooked black beans
- 2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1.5 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1dl chunky salsa
- 1dl breadcrumbs
- hamburgers buns
 
directions:
1. Add all ingredients to a food processor. Process for 45-60 seconds, until all ingredients are blended together, but still a little bit chunky. Transfer mixture to a medium sized bowl and refrigerate for about ten minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and form mixture into patties. You will get about 4-6 Â patties, depending on the size you make them. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and place black bean burgers on. Refrigerator for about 20 minutes.
2. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with olive oil. Cook the burgers for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until crisp and heated through. Top with your favorite burger toppings and enjoy!
